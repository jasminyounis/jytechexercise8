      Overview:
    </h2>
    <p>
      The example from the Paper.js I chose to edit was the Rounded Rectangle. The orginal rounded rectangle was red, white, and blue

      <br>
      <a href="http://paperjs.org/examples/rounded-rectangles/">Original Rounded Rectangle!</a><br />
      <br />
      What I did to edit the Rounded Rectangle was change the colors to red,black, light blue, and violet. I also edited the shape of the Rounded Rectangle to where it is more circular/sphere-like and the amount of space it takes up on the canvas is smaller.
